# buddy-group-project
This project, undertaken as part of the CYF full-stack course in JavaScript Core module 3, aimed to foster collaboration within an agile environment.

My role involved taking charge of UI design using Figma, working seamlessly with team members to successfully develop and deploy the MVP for MRecycle, a mobile phone recycling website.

The deployment was achieved within a week, leveraging Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

I actively participated in pair programming, conducted code reviews, and contributed to the project's overall success.

This experience not only enhanced my technical skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML but also provided valuable insights into effective teamwork and collaborative project management methodologies.
